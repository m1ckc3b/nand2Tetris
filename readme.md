# Nand To Tetris - Part 2

## Project 0
In this project, there are two exercices (Mult and Fill).
To pass the first one, it necessary to implement a loop because there is no multiplier command implemented in the ALU. So, it is possible to replace multiplication by an addition. In the loop, it need to adds up R0 many times as R1. Example: R0=7 and R1=5, so R2=R0+R0+R0+R0+R0.
